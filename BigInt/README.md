yall know how you struggle with overflow errors in C and Cpp, i try to fix that with arbitrary precision integers, negative numbers? NOT SUPPORTED, floats? NOT SUPPORED, subtraction? NOT SUPPORTED

you can have positive numbers tho! does have a limit, that limit is something you will NOT reach (dont try flex, we know you dont have that much ram)

please stop reading this, i cant make READMEs 

contributions ARE welcome, idc about style guides type shit
